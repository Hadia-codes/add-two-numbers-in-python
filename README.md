# ➕ Add Two Numbers

🔧 **Project Name:**  
Beginner-Friendly Python Function for Adding Two Numbers

📘 **Description:**  
This simple Python project is designed for beginners who are just starting with programming. It introduces you to defining functions, accepting user input, and displaying results in a clean and understandable way.

You’ll write a short script that asks for two numbers, adds them using a function called `add()`, and prints the result. It’s a great way to build confidence with Python syntax and flow.

🧠 **How It Works:**

▶ **Python Script (add_two_numbers.py):**
- Prompts the user to enter two numbers using `input()`
- Converts input to `float` to handle decimal values
- Defines a function `add(num1, num2)` that returns the sum
- Stores the result in a variable
- Prints the final output

📊 **Sample Output:**
```

Write a number: 5.5
Another number: 3.2
The result is: 8.7

```

💻 **Tech Stack:**
- Python 3.x
- Runs in any terminal, Python IDE, or notebook

⚙ **File Structure:**
```

project-folder/
│
└── add\_two\_numbers.py    # Main Python file

```

🚀 **Future Ideas:**
- Extend the script to support subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Add error handling (e.g., if the user types a letter instead of a number)
- Build a simple GUI using Tkinter for button-based number input
